1. Sampling should run only once per year

We will run sampling only once for each measurement year. This is to make sure we don’t select different samples by mistake if the process runs again.


---

2. Sampling starts after FQR is completed

Sampling will only happen after the final quality checks (FQR) are done. This means the data is complete, clean, and approved by the QA team.


---

3. Sampling should use frozen data

Once FQR is passed, we take a copy of the data and freeze it. This frozen version doesn’t change and is used for sampling. It ensures the same data is used for audit and reporting later.


---

4. Get sampling tables using runConfigId

From the incoming JSON request, we get a value called runConfigId.
We use this to look up which tables we need to run sampling on (from metadata tables like RunConfiguration and SourceDetail).


---

5. Use metadata table for sample size

We use the metadata table hedisMeasureSampleSizeInfo to decide how many members we need in our sample (this number is called MRSS — Minimum Required Sample Size).


---

6. Reduce sample size based on rate

If we have a good result from last year or this year’s admin data, we can reduce the number of members we need to sample (MRSS).
We choose the lowest rate between current year and prior year.


---

7. For inverse measures, use 100 - rate

Some measures (like GSD2) use an inverse rate. So instead of using the rate directly, we subtract it from 100 and then use that to reduce sample size.


---

8. Oversampling logic

We add some extra members in the sample (usually 10%) in case some are later found invalid (e.g., deceased).
This percentage is configurable, but can’t be more than 20% unless we get approval.


---

9. Sorting eligible members

When we pick members, we sort them alphabetically by last name, first name, date of birth, and event date.
In even years (like MY2024) we sort from A to Z. In odd years (like MY2023), we sort Z to A.


---

10. How we choose members

We use a random number (RAND) to pick a starting point.
Then we select every "ith" member using a formula. This makes the sample more fair and spread out.


---

11. Store the actual MRSS

If we only have 120 members, we store MRSS as 120 — not the standard 411. This gives an accurate count of how many members were truly available for sampling.


---

12. Shared samples across related measures

For some related measures (like GSD, EED, and BPD), if the client chooses to use the same sample:

Then sampled and oversample members must match

And if one member is excluded from one measure, they should be excluded from all



---

13. Visit-based measures

Some measures (like TRC and PPC) are based on visits, not members.
So the same member can appear multiple times in the sample if they had multiple qualifying visits.


---

14. Exclude invalid members

After sampling, we should remove members who are invalid (e.g., deceased, employee, hospice).
Then we replace them using members from the oversample list.


---

15. Update sampling status in DB

Once sampling is done, update the MRR table:

Set campaignStatus = 'PROCESSED'

Set isSamplingProcessed = 1

Who are Eligible Members (EM) in HEDIS Sampling?

Eligible Members are those members who meet all the basic criteria defined for a specific HEDIS hybrid measure. These are the people from whom we are allowed to pick samples.


---

General Criteria to Be Eligible:

1. Enrolled in a valid product line
(e.g., Commercial, Medicaid, Medicare)


2. Have the required age and gender
(e.g., for Breast Cancer Screening, only women aged 50–74)


3. Have continuous enrollment
for the time period required by the measure (e.g., full measurement year)


4. Have qualifying events
like visits, procedures, diagnoses, based on the measure's logic


5. Have a valid provider or health plan association




---

Who is NOT Eligible (Must Be Excluded)?

Members marked as deceased

Those under hospice care

Employees of the health plan

Records flagged as duplicate or invalid

Members outside the age/gender limits of the measure



---

Example for a Hybrid Measure (e.g., GSD)

To be eligible:

Member should have had a diagnosis of diabetes

Be between 18–75 years old

Be enrolled for at least 11 months

Not be in hospice or deceased

How You Can Explain to Your Colleague:

> “Eligible members are those who qualify for a specific HEDIS measure based on rules like age, diagnosis, enrollment, and visit history. We apply these filters first, and then run sampling only on the members who pass all of them.”
