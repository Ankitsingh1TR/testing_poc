Sampling should run only once per measurement year, based on frozen data after the FQR stage.

Sampling logic will be triggered using runConfigId from the JSON request, which helps identify the target tables using the SourceDetailId.

MRSS (Minimum Required Sample Size) is derived using metadata table hedisMeasureSampleSizeInfo. It can be reduced using the lowest value among prior year’s audited rate or current year’s admin rate.

For inverse measures like GSD2, use 100 - (rate) before applying MRSS reduction.

Oversampling percentage is configurable (default 10%) and should not exceed 20% unless there is NCQA approval.

If Eligible Members (EM) <= MRSS, include all EMs in the sample.

If EM > MRSS + OS, apply systematic sampling logic using calculated values:

Calculate N = EM / (MRSS + OS)

Get START = RAND × N

Select each ith member using:
ith_member = START + [(i-1) × (EM / (MRSS + OS))]
(rounding as per .5 rule)


Sort eligible members in alphabetical order using last name, first name, DOB, and event date. For MY2024 (even year), sort from A to Z.

Ensure oversample members are consistent when same samples are shared between grouped measures like GSD, EED, BPD.

If any member is excluded due to valid data errors (e.g., deceased, hospice, employee), it should be replaced from the oversample list, and exclusion must reflect across all related measures.

Once sampling is completed:

Update hedisSamplingRequest_MRR:
campaignStatus = 'PROCESSED'
issamplingprocessed = 1


Save the actual MRSS value in DB (e.g., if only 110 members are available, store 110 instead of default 411).

Sampling logic will be based on metadata tables:

hedisMeasureSampleSizeInfo (MRSS)

hedisSampleSizeCurrentOrPriorYearConfig (rate-based MRSS reduction)

hedisMeasuresRandValue (RAND values for START)


TRC and PPC are visit-based sampling measures, so the same member may appear multiple times if they have multiple qualifying visits.

Shared sampling logic, exclusions, and sorting direction should all follow measurement year-specific rules mentioned in the BRD.
