MP and PP Completion

MP stands for Measure Processing – this step computes eligibility, applies HEDIS logic, and prepares the output per measure.

PP stands for Post Processing – this step finalizes and formats the data post-MP, including audit readiness and preparation for freezing.

Both MP and PP must be fully completed for the measurement year before sampling can be triggered.

✅ 2. Final Quality Review (FQR)

Sampling can be executed only after FQR is complete.

Post FQR, data is considered final and is frozen (locked) for consistent sampling and audit.

✅ 3. RE Data (Raw Extract) in Parquet Format

RE stands for Raw Extract, which refers to source-level data tables provided in Parquet format.

These include:

RE_Member, RE_Claims, RE_Encounter, RE_Eligibility, RE_Diagnosis, RE_Procedure, RE_Medication, RE_Product, RE_Provider, RE_Lab, etc.


All required RE tables must be fully populated and validated as part of pre-sampling data setup.

✅ 4. List of Applicable Hybrid Measures for MY25

Sampling in MY25 applies to the following 8 hybrid measures:

WCC – Weight Assessment and Counseling

LSC – Lead Screening in Children

COA – Care for Older Adults

CBP – Controlling High Blood Pressure

GSD – Glycemic Status Assessment for Diabetes

BPD – Blood Pressure Control for Diabetes

TRC – Transitions of Care

PPC – Prenatal and Postpartum Care


These measures may have sub-parts (e.g., TRC by discharge type, PPC by delivery event), and sampling logic must account for those where applicable.

✅ 5. Metadata and Request Tables – Must Be Preloaded

Sampling depends on the following three metadata tables and one request table, which must be available and populated before execution:

Table Name	Purpose

hedisMeasureSampleSizeInfo	Provides standard MRSS values per product line
hedisSampleSizeCurrentOrPriorYearConfig	Stores CYAR and PYAR values for sample size reduction
hedisMeasuresRandValue	Stores RAND values used to determine sampling START position
hedisSamplingRequest	Receives runtime sampling parameters, including measure, product, runConfigId


These four tables are considered strict prerequisites for launching the sampling module.
