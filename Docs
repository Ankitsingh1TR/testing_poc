To implement the metadata-driven sampling logic for HEDIS Hybrid Measures using Spark, by processing MRR JSON data and resolving appropriate sampling properties (CYAR, PYR, OverSamplingRate) as per business rules.

üîÑ High-Level Workflow

Step	Description

1Ô∏è‚É£	Fetch JSON request from hedisSamplingRequest_MRR table using correlationId
2Ô∏è‚É£	Flatten the JSON structure to extract MeasureGroup, SubMeasures, CYAR, PYR, ProductCategory, etc.
3Ô∏è‚É£	Apply business overrides (e.g., invert CYAR/PYR for HBD2, GSD2)
4Ô∏è‚É£	Filter out specific SubMeasure exclusions (HBD1, BPD, GSD1) and Exchange product lines
5Ô∏è‚É£	Join with hedisMeasuresSampleSizeInfo to resolve which measure uses CYAR or PYR
6Ô∏è‚É£	Join with vw_healthPlanProductCategory for submission year mapping
7Ô∏è‚É£	Take minimum available valid value between CYAR and PYR
8Ô∏è‚É£	Output the sampling factors (MeasureCode, ProductLine, SubmissionId, OverSamplingRate, and resolved CYAR/PYR value)

üìÇ Data Sources Used

Source Table/View	Purpose

hedisSamplingRequest_MRR	Input MRR request (contains JSON structure)
hedisMeasuresSampleSizeInfo	Indicates which measure uses CYAR or PYR
vw_healthPlanProductCategory	Maps submission ID to Measurement Year

üîë Key SP3 Properties Explained

Property	Extracted From	Description

MeasureCode	data.measureGroup	Grouped measure used for sampling
ClinicalMeasureId	subMeasures.clinicalSubMeasureId	Individual sub-measure (used for exclusions and override logic)
ProductLine	productCategory	Used to exclude Exchange lines
CYAR, PYR	subMeasures.cyar / pyr	Sampling rate percentages
OverSamplingRate	data.oversamplingRate / 100	Converted to decimal for sampling
SubmissionId	submissionId	Used to join with plan mapping
OrganizationId	organizationId	Used for traceability
CorrelationId	from request context	Execution ID for identifying the request
MeasurementYear	measurementYear	Used to join with metadata table



---

üîÑ Special Override Logic

Condition	Action

If ClinicalMeasureId is HBD2 or GSD2	Replace CYAR = 100 - CYAR, PYR = 100 - PYR
If ClinicalMeasureId is HBD1, GSD1, or BPD	Exclude from processing
If ProductLine = Exchange	Exclude from processing

üßÆ Sampling Factor Resolution Logic

1. Join request with hedisMeasuresSampleSizeInfo

Use matching MeasureCode

Only keep rows matching measurementYear



2. Check if metadata defines:

cyar = 'CYAR' ‚Üí pick CYAR

pyr = 'PYR'   ‚Üí pick PYR



3. Use min(CYAR), min(PYR) at group level (some measures have multiple sub-measures)


4. Final fallback logic:

CYAR_PYR = COALESCE(min_CYAR, min_PYR)

No temp tables required (in-memory transformations)

Scalable across submissions and years

Fully traceable with correlationId

Easily testable with .show() or .write().csv()
